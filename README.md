## About

VimR is a Neovim GUI for macOS written in Swift.

The goal is to build an editor that uses Neovim inside with some of the convenience
GUI features similar to those present in modern editors.

There are other Neovim GUIs for macOS, see the [list](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects#gui), so why?

- Play around with [Neovim](https://github.com/qvacua/neovim),
- play around with Swift (and especially with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)),
- Play around with the main idea of Redux architecture, and
- (most importantly) have fun!

## Download

Pre-built Universal signed and notarized binaries can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/releases).

## Reusable Components

* [NvimView](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/NvimView): SwiftPM module containing
  an NSView which bundles everything, e.g., Neovim binary and its `runtime`-files, needed to 
  embed Neovim in a Cocoa App.
* [RxMsgpackRpc](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/RxPack/Sources/RxPack/RxMsgpackRpc.swift): Implementation of MsgpackRpc using RxSwift.
* [RxNeovimApi](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/RxPack/Sources/RxNeovim): RxSwift wrapper of Neovim API.

## Some Features

* Markdown preview
* Generic HTML preview (retains the scroll position when reloading)
* Fuzzy file finder a la Xcode's "Open Quickly..."
* Trackpad support: Pinching for zooming and two-finger scrolling.
* Ligatures: Turned off by default. Turn it on in the Preferences.
* Command line tool.
* (Simple) File browser
* Flexible workspace model a la JetBrain's IDEs
